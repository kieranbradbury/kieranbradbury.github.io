								<p><b> 08/22 - Games Jam - Spooky Shooter </b></p>
								<p> This Game was made by myself, <a href="https://morgandcbailey.github.io/">Morgan Bailey</a>, & <a href="https://robbinbob.wixsite.com/portfolio"> Scott Lee</a> in the Staffordshire University Welcome Week Games Jam.<br />
									The was a lot of freedom with what game we could build and we decided to go for a Carnival Minigame like Duck Shooter.<br />
									A big part of the Games Jam was learning how to work with people on a Programming Project, figuring out what everyone's Skills are and how we could best Utilise everyone's anilities to create a good Game.<br />
								  It was a lot of fun and the resulting Game we were very proud of.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><b> 11/22 - Prototype - Side-Scroller-Shooter </b></p>
								<p> This Side Scroller Prototype was the first Game I developed at Staffordshire University.<br />
									It is a very simple Game of survival, you play as a solitary Spaceship, attacking and Defending against Waves of Enemy Ships.<br />
									The Main function I was Prototyping was Basic AI. I had never attempted even the simplest of Enemy driving AI and thought it would be a good place to start.<br />
								  It was a great learning Experience even if I did it the long winded way.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><b> 11/22 - MiniGame - Pac-Man Based MiniGame </b></p>
								<p> This MiniGame was the first 2D OOP game I had ever built, and made it as part of my Coursework at Staffordshire University<br />
									It is just a basic Maze Game where the player has to collect Objects and avoid the Enemies.<br />
									The main feature being learnt during this Project was Memory Management, focusing on how to optimise each and every aspect of the Game.</p>
