								<p><b> 05/22 - Graphics Systems Development </b></p>
								<p> The Module Fundamentals of Games and Graphics Systems
									show us how to build a Graphics Pipeline within Visual Studio using OpenGL.<br />
									This was by far the most difficult module of the first year
									because it required eveything to be made from scratch,
									everything new added that wasn't apart of lectures
									 needed researching and troubleshooting.<br />
									It posed quite a challenge to get evrything working but
									was very enjoyable learning how these systems get put together.<br />

								<p><b> 05/22 - Games Engine Creation </b></p>
								<p> This module was an introduction to C++, teaching the basics
									and then creating a 2D Platformer through SDL.<br />
									It was not too difficult to grasp C++ as it is quite similar to C#,
									which I had used in my previously modules in the year.<br />
									The only issues I had was time, at this point I was working on 4 different projects
									 and was unalbe to get to animating the characters,
									but was very happy with th skills I had learned.<br />

								<p><b> 11/22 - Prototype - Side-Scroller-Shooter </b></p>
								<p> This Side Scroller Prototype was the first Game
									I developed at Staffordshire University.<br />
									It is a very simple Game of survival, you play as a solitary Spaceship,
									 attacking and Defending against Waves of Enemy Ships.<br />
									The Main function I was Prototyping was Basic AI.
									I had never attempted even the simplest of Enemy driving AI and thought it
									would be a good place to start.<br />
									It was a great learning Experience even if I did it the long winded way.</p>

								<p><b> 03/23 - Prototype - 2D Platformer </b> </p>
								<p> For one of my first year Projects at Staffordshire University,
									I built this 2D Platformer. <br />
									Because of the Framework Styling, I was able to experiment
									 with the Tile sets and Level Design which I quite Enjoyed.<br />
									It was also my first look into making a Platformer,
									so I thoroughly enjoyed learning this game style.<br />

								<p><b> 08/22 - Games Jam - Spooky Shooter </b></p>
								<p> This Game was made by myself, <a href="https://morgandcbailey.github.io/">Morgan Bailey</a>, & <a href="https://robbinbob.wixsite.com/portfolio"> Scott Lee</a>
									in the Staffordshire University Welcome Week Games Jam.<br />
									The was a lot of freedom with what game we could build
									 and we decided to go for a Carnival Minigame like Duck Shooter.<br />
									A big part of the Games Jam was learning how to
									 work with people on a Programming Project,
									figuring out what everyone's Skills are
									and how we could best Utilise everyone's anilities to create a good Game.<br />
								   It was a lot of fun and the resulting Game we were very proud of.

								<p><b> 01/23 - Global Games Jam - Plants Strike Back! </b></p>
								<p> This Game was made by myself and <a href="https://morgandcbailey.github.io/">Morgan Bailey</a> in the annual Global Games Jam.<br />
									The Theme for the Jam was Roots, which was a difficult
									topic for us to think of a Game Scenario.<br />
									We settled on a 3D FPS because that's where our skills were at the time,
									although it didn't line up with the Spec properly,
									it was our first official Jam and had a lot of fun making the game.</p>
