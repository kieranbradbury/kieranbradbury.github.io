								<p><b> 05/23 - Prototype - Top-Down-Shooter </b> </p>
								<p> For my last first year Project at Staffordshire University, I built this Top-Down Shooter. <br />
									Because of the Framework Styling, I was able to experiment with the Tile sets and Level Design which I quite Enjoyed.
									It was also my first look into making a more developed game with extra features and mechanics to make it feel more progressive,
									I think i did this quite well with the unlockable weapons and expandable play space.

								<p><b> 11/22 - Prototype - Side-Scroller-Shooter </b></p>
								<p> This Side Scroller Prototype was the first Game I developed at Staffordshire University.<br />
									It is a very simple Game of survival, you play as a solitary Spaceship, attacking and Defending against Waves of Enemy Ships.<br />
									The Main function I was Prototyping was Basic AI. 
									I had never attempted even the simplest of Enemy driving AI and thought it 
									would be a good place to start.<br />
								  It was a great learning Experience even if I did it the long winded way.</p>

								<p><b> 08/22 - Games Jam - Spooky Shooter </b></p>
								<p> This Game was made by myself, <a href="https://morgandcbailey.github.io/">Morgan Bailey</a>, & <a href="https://robbinbob.wixsite.com/portfolio"> Scott Lee</a> 
									in the Staffordshire University Welcome Week Games Jam.<br />
									The was a lot of freedom with what game we could build and we decided to go for a Carnival Minigame like Duck Shooter.<br />
									A big part of the Games Jam was learning how to work with people on a Programming Project, 
									figuring out what everyone's Skills are 
									and how we could best Utilise everyone's anilities to create a good Game.<br />
								   It was a lot of fun and the resulting Game we were very proud of.

								<p><b> 01/23 - Global Games Jam - Plants Strike Back! </b></p>
								<p> This Game was made by myself and <a href="https://morgandcbailey.github.io/">Morgan Bailey</a> in the annual Global Games Jam.<br />
									The Theme for the Jam was Roots, which was a difficult topic for us to think of a Game Scenario.<br />
									We settled on a 3D FPS because that's where our skills were at the time, 
									although it didn't line up with the Spec properly, 
									it was our first official Jam and had a lot of fun making the game.</p>
